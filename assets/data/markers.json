While Death Valley is comprised of rugged wilderness areas and is famous for its extreme climate, the night skies above the park are as fragile as the land below. The Park is largely free of its own sources of light pollution but the lights of distant Las Vegas and other cities have an impact on the park’s skies and desert nightlife.",

In addition to its spectacular daytime vistas of the Warrumbungle Mountain Range, the Park has long been known for the quality of its dark night skies. In the 1950s, seeking relief from the light pollution of Canberra that negatively impacted its Mount Stromlo Observatory, the Australian government relocated major operations to a new observatory at Siding Spring. Now operated by the Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the Australian National University, Siding Spring Observatory is home to the 4-meter Anglo-Australian Telescope, the largest in Australia. Lessons learned at Mount Stromlo encouraged early conservation of dark skies in the area, including at Warrumbungle, to protect the national investment in Australia’s professional astronomy infrastructure.",

    "description": "It is the southernmost national park in Japan, in its southernmost prefecture, and preserves the only tropical rainforest in the country. In addition to large mangrove communities at the mouths of broad rivers, the islands are ringed by living coral reefs. The Park provides refuge for a number of threatened plant and animal species, and Iriomote Island is home to the critically endangered Iriomote cat (Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis), discovered only fifty years ago. The Park also represents an unusual set of circumstances for the preservation and promotion of dark skies. The Yaeyama Islands support a permanent population of about 54,000 people settled in and among the Park’s territory. They are governed by two municipalities, Ishigaki City and Taketomi Town, who along with the Japanese Ministry of the Environment are responsible for the administration of the Park. The population is heavily concentrated into Ishigaki City on Ishigaki Island, which serves as Yaeyama’s sea port, airport, and main commercial hub. Despite a city of this size within the boundaries of the Park, much of the land area of the islands routinely achieves Silver- and Gold-tier night sky quality.",

Because the site was intended to be preserved largely in this primitive state, it was spared from the widespread deployment of artificial light.

Efforts to protect these conditions began as a means of providing better environmental conditions for birds and have since expanded to make the Park an attractive and convenient des- tination for residents of coastal Western Europe seeking readily accessible, Silver-tier dark skies.",

Famous for its white chalk cliffs, Møn offers visitors a slower pace of life compared to the bigger cities of Europe, complete with open countryside, sandy Baltic Sea beaches, and shopping in the market town of Stege. In 2014, residents of Møn began an effort to promote the Islands’ dark skies as a means of economic development and tourism potential, culminating in a joint effort for IDA recognition as both an International Dark Sky Community and an International Dark Sky Park. The reasoning for this approach is that it results in better protection of current nighttime conditions in both the developed and wilderness areas of both islands.",

As a result, its night skies are considerably darker on average than in the northern, more heavily-populated areas of the country. Coupled with typically good weather and a dry climate, the Negev increasingly draws stargazers from across the Middle East and Europe. The situation of Ramon Crater within this environment offers a substantial degree of long-term protection for its night skies. The management of the site has added offerings of nighttime interpretive programs and stargazing opportunities, and has lately reached out to neighboring communities and organizations to partner with them in activities intended to help preserve the Crater’s dark skies and promote astrotourism for regional economic development.",

Interest in stargazing at the site began over a decade ago, and has grown into an industry served by a small tourism infrastructure. Visitors can participate in weekly nighttime astronomy events led by trained local staff, and have free rein around the Alm at night. It is a largely defensible location, both due to the mountainous topography and effective outdoor lighting policies in both the municipality and the Park itself.",

After the initial proposal signing, the project expanded its outreach by working with the surrounding 17 municipalities and the Lighting Society of Hungary to minimize the communities’ impacts on the park. Finally, the outdoor lighting renovation of the Hotel Kardosfa and the surrounding park recreational buildings to include dark sky friendly lighting assisted in minimizing the light pollution impacts from within the park. Zselic is one of the best places with close to unaltered dark night skies in Hungary. The Triangulum Galaxy can be seen with the naked eye on clear nights, and the zodiacal light is often visible in spring and autumn.",
