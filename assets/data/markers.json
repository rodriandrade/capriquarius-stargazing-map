The Park is largely free of its own sources of light pollution but the lights of distant Las Vegas and other cities have an impact on the park’s skies and desert nightlife.",

In addition to its spectacular daytime vistas of the Warrumbungle Mountain Range, the Park has long been known for the quality of its dark night skies. In the 1950s, seeking relief from the light pollution of Canberra that negatively impacted its Mount Stromlo Observatory, the Australian government relocated major operations to a new observatory at Siding Spring. Now operated by the Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the Australian National University, Siding Spring Observatory is home to the 4-meter Anglo-Australian Telescope, the largest in Australia. Lessons learned at Mount Stromlo encouraged early conservation of dark skies in the area, including at Warrumbungle, to protect the national investment in Australia’s professional astronomy infrastructure.",

      "description": "The aurora season on the Kola Peninsula in northeastern Russia extends from late August until April, but winter is the best time to see the lights. This is because the region, which sits within the Arctic Circle, boasts 42 polar nights, meaning the area is shrouded in total darkness for more than 24 hours. It's also one of the more temperate and accessible regions in Russia where you can chase the aurora. The best place to view the lights on the peninsula is from the small port city of Murmansk, which is located in the northwest part of the region. To see other parts of the region, opt for an eight-day tour with Russia Discovery. This package includes viewing the northern lights, visiting the tundra and coastline of the Arctic Ocean, meeting the indigenous Sámi people, snowmobiling in the Khibiny mountains and exploring St. Petersburg.",
